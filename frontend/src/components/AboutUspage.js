          Haludulu is a creative all you can get store created by three good
          mates who are always daydreaming about their future. We realize that
          without the people in our lives we wouldnâ€™t be where we are today, so
          our collections will be dedicated to the beautiful individuals that
          have stuck with us since day1 to make our collection bigger than just
          a piece of garment. We would also love to hear the stories about your
          heroes and help you in creating a peace that will be dedicated to
          them.
